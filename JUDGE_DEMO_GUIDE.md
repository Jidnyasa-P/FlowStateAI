## 🎪 5 Demo Moments (Judge Wow Factor)

### 1. Energy Index Card (Top of Dashboard)
**What to Show**: Large circular energy score indicator
- Displays all 5 behavioral signals with visual bars
- Shows current cognitive energy state (Low/Balanced/Optimal)
- **Judge Appeal**: "This is non-intrusive self-reporting, not keystroke tracking"

**Talking Point**: 
> "Unlike productivity tools that spy on employees, FlowState only asks users to self-report their mood and track their task metrics. Everything is ethical and privacy-safe."

---

### 2. AI Recommended Workflow Card
**What to Show**: Context-aware AI recommendation
- Different recommendations based on energy level
- Interactive buttons to activate focus or recovery
- **Judge Appeal**: Shows the system actually ACTS on energy, not just measures it

**Talking Point**:
> "This isn't just analytics. The system sees your energy is low and recommends a break. If errors spike, it suggests easier tasks. It's adaptive."

---

### 3. Focus Readiness Panel
**What to Show**: Deep work readiness assessment
- Progress bar indicating readiness level
- Adjustable session duration slider
- Messages that change based on energy state
- **Judge Appeal**: Practical, user-centric feature

**Talking Point**:
> "At peak energy (80+), we tell users 'Deep work optimal.' Below 40, we say 'Recovery needed.' This guidance is powered by the energy model."

---

### 4. Burnout Risk Monitor
**What to Show**: Risk zones with trend indicators
- 5-day average energy calculation
- Color-coded risk levels (🔴 High / 🟡 Moderate / 🟢 Stable)
- Trend arrow (improving/declining)
- **Judge Appeal**: Predictive feature showing system thinking ahead

**Talking Point**:
> "We calculate 5-day average energy. If it drops below 45, the system proactively warns of burnout risk. This prevents problems before they happen."

---

### 5. Contextual Signal Calibration Panel ⭐ (THE WOW MOMENT)
**What to Show**: Interactive signal adjustment with live updates
- **Adjust these sliders in sequence**:
  1. Error Frequency (0-100%) - increase it
  2. Idle Duration (0-100%) - increase it
  3. Mood Index (1-5) - drag the emoji slider
  4. Task Switching Rate (0-15) - increase it
  5. Completion Efficiency (0-100%) - decrease it

- **Watch in real-time**:
  - Energy score updates instantly
  - AI recommendation changes dynamically
  - All with smooth animations

- **Click "Show Breakdown"** to reveal the formula calculation

**Judge Appeal**: This is THE differentiator
> "See how the energy score updates in real-time as you adjust behavioral signals? This is our judges seeing the system in action. The algorithm is transparent, adjustable, and responds immediately."

## 🎤 Key Talking Points

### The Energy Formula (Non-Intrusive)
```
Energy = (Efficiency × 0.35) +
         (Mood × 0.20) -
         (Errors × 0.25) -
         (Idle × 0.10) -
         (Switches × 0.10)
```

**Emphasize**:
- Self-reported only (no browser tracking)
- Mood input shows we respect user privacy
- Transparent weights (judges can see why energy dropped)
- Result: 0-100 scale for easy interpretation

### Decision Engine
- Energy < 40: "Take a short break"
- Error Rate > 40%: "Switch to easier task"
- Energy > 80: "Deep work mode ready"
- Default: "Continue workflow"

**Emphasize**: This is ADAPTATION, not just measurement.

### 🎯 Judge Questions (Likely)

**Q: "Where do these signals come from?"**  
A: "User task interaction plus optional mood input. Self-reported, ethical, non-intrusive."

**Q: "How is this different from habit trackers?"**  
A: "We don't just measure—we adapt. Energy score drives actual recommendations. The system acts, not just watches."

**Q: "What's the burnout prediction based on?"**  
A: "5-day average energy. If dropping below 45, we flag high risk. Predictive, not reactive."

**Q: "Can users game the system?"**  
A: "The calibration panel shows judges how the algorithm works. Everything is transparent. Users seeing 'Take a break' when they report low mood will trust the system."

**Q: "How do you prevent burnout?"**  
A: "By surfacing risk early. The 5-day trend tells us before the person crashes. Admin can see this and intervene."
